## **1. Introduction**

**ImMesh** (pronounced as "***I-am-Mesh***") is a novel LiDAR(-inertial) odometry and meshing framework, which takes advantage of input of LiDAR data, achieving the goal of **simultaneous localization and meshing** in real-time. ImMesh comprises four tightly-coupled modules: receiver, localization, meshing, and broadcaster. The localization module utilizes the prepossessed sensor data from the receiver, estimates the sensor pose online by registering LiDAR scans to maps, and dynamically grows the map. Then, our meshing module takes the registered LiDAR scan for **incrementally reconstructing the triangle mesh on the fly**. Finally, the real-time odometry, map, and mesh are published via our broadcaster.

## 3. Prerequisites
### 3.1 **ROS**
Following this [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) to install ROS and its additional pacakge:<br>
```
sudo apt-get install ros-XXX-cv-bridge ros-XXX-tf ros-XXX-message-filters ros-XXX-image-transport ros-XXX-image-transport*
```
**NOTICE:** remember to replace "XXX" on above command as your ROS distributions, for example, if your use ROS-kinetic, the command should be:<br>
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-cv-bridge ros-kinetic-tf ros-kinetic-message-filters ros-kinetic-image-transport*
```
### 3.2. **livox_ros_driver**
Follow this [livox_ros_driver Installation](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver).

### 3.3 **CGAL** and **OpenGL**
```
sudo apt-get install -y libcgal-dev pcl-tools
sudo apt-get install -y libgl-dev libglm-dev libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libglw1-mesa-dev 
sudo apt-get install -y libcgal-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev
```
## 4. Build ImMesh on ROS:
Clone this repository and catkin_make:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/hku-mars/ImMesh.git
cd ../
catkin_make
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## 5. Run our examples
### 5.1 Solid-state LiDAR (e.g., Livox LiDARs)
ImMesh is capable run with solid-state LiDAR (e.g., Livox-avia form ([r3live_dataset](https://github.com/ziv-lin/r3live_dataset))). 

Our example rosbag files for evaluation can be download from our [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15i-TRa0EA8BCbNdARVqPMDsU9JOlagVF?usp=sharing) or [Baidu-NetDisk [百度网盘]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zmVxkcwOSul8oTBwaHfuFg) (code提取码: wwxw). 

After you have downloaded our bag files, you can now run our example ^_^
```
roslaunch ImMesh mapping_avia.launch
rosbag play YOUR_DOWNLOADED.bag
``` 

### 5.2 Mechanical spinning LiDAR (e.g., Velodyne and Ouster LiDARs)
ImMesh is also capable to mechanical spinning LiDAR (e.g., Velodyne LiDAR form ([KITTI-dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php), [NCLT-dataset](https://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt), and [NTU-VIRAL](https://ntu-aris.github.io/ntu_viral_dataset/) ). 

We also provide some example rosbag files for evaluation (thanks for [KITTI-dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) and  [NCLT-dataset](https://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt)) , which can be download from our [OneDrive](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zivlin_connect_hku_hk/EkoRwaDJskVOpeZTetFDQNYBdKwfRYvvHJyncLTM78t13w?e=Tte1Lh).

After you have preparation of rosbag files, you can now run our example with:

For [KITTI-dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php):
```
roslaunch ImMesh mapping_velody64.launch
rosbag play YOUR_DOWNLOADED.bag
``` 

For [NCLT-dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php):
```
roslaunch ImMesh mapping_nclt.launch
rosbag play YOUR_DOWNLOADED.bag
``` 

For [NTU-VIRAL](https://ntu-aris.github.io/ntu_viral_dataset):
```
roslaunch ImMesh mapping_ntu_viral.launch
rosbag play YOUR_DOWNLOADED.bag
``` 

### 5.2 Fast offline mesh reconstruction with given pointcloud file

ImMesh can also perform the fast offline mesh reconstruction with given point cloud file (*.pcd). Modified the pointcloud file name in mapping_pointcloud.launch:

```
# In mapping_pointcloud.launch file:
<param name="pc_name" type="string" value="YOUR_POINTCLOUD.pcd" />
```

Then, perform the mesh reconstruction with:
```
roslaunch ImMesh mapping_pointcloud.launch
```

## 6. Result and tips.
If everything is correct, you will get the result same as the screenshot shown in below:

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/ziv-lin/ImMesh_release/raw/main/pics/ImMesh_gui.jpg" alt="video" width="100%" />
</div>

We provide some functions/features/demonstrations in our GUI (implemented based on [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) ), for example, as listed as below (press "*F1*" key for help):

### 6.1 LiDAR pointcloud reinforcement

Click "*enable*" checkbox (under the treenode of "*LiDAR pointcloud reinforcement*") to toggle realtime real-time depth rasterization and LiDAR pointcloud reinforcement. 

Tips: You can click the "*Dynamic configuration*" checkbox to online dynamic reconfigure the rasterization parameter.

### 6.2 Export the reconstructed mesh result to disk
ImMesh allow you to save the online reconstructed mesh you build at anytime you wanted. 

Click the "*Save Mesh to PLY file*" button (on the Main windows panel) to export the mesh to PLY file (default save in directory: ${HOME}/ImMesh_output).

### 6.3 Other features
Due to the space limitation, we are unable to list out all our features on this page. We recommend you to explore our work through GUI interaction by yourself.

I hope you will love and enjoy our work, ImMesh. If you feel like ImMesh has indeed helped in your current research or work, I would greatly appreciate it if you could give a star to this repository or cite our paper in your academic research paper.:)
